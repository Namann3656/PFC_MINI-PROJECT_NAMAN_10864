🚆 Project Title
Railway Ticket Booking System

🎯 Aim
The aim of this project is to design a simple Railway Ticket Booking System using an array-based approach. It allows users to:
- Book seats
- Cancel bookings
- View the current status of all seats

📝 Project Details
This project is built using a 1D array, where each index represents a seat in the train.
- Initially, all seats are marked as available.
- A menu-driven loop system lets the user choose actions (book, cancel, view).
- Before booking or canceling, the program checks the seat’s status to avoid errors.
- The array is updated based on user actions, and the seat status is displayed using loops.

💡 Why This Project Was Made
- To demonstrate basic data structures (arrays) in a practical application.
- To show how loops and condition checks can be used to manage real-world problems.
- To provide a beginner-friendly project for students learning programming concepts.

🔧 Utility
- Helps understand how reservation systems work in real life.
- Can be extended to larger systems like bus booking, cinema ticket booking, or airline reservations.
- Useful for practicing menu-driven programs, array manipulation, and user input handling.

🌍 Future Scope
- Add multiple trains and different classes of seats (Sleeper, AC, General).
- Integrate with a database for storing passenger details.
- Add payment gateway simulation for complete booking experience.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Extend to online booking systems with web or mobile apps.
